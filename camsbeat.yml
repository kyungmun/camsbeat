#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# Multiple outputs may be used.

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  #protocol: "https"

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

  # Client Certificate Key
  #ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

#------------------------------- Kafka output ----------------------------------
#output.kafka:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  #enabled: true

  # The list of Kafka broker addresses from where to fetch the cluster metadata.
  # The cluster metadata contain the actual Kafka brokers events are published
  # to.
  #hosts: ["10.165.60.52:9092"]

  # The Kafka topic used for produced events. The setting can be a format string
  # using any event field. To set the topic from document type use `%{[type]}`.
  #topic: camsbeat-66

  # The Kafka event key setting. Use format string to create unique event key.
  # By default no event key will be generated.
  #key: ''

  # The Kafka event partitioning strategy. Default hashing strategy is `hash`
  # using the `output.kafka.key` setting or randomly distributes events if
  # `output.kafka.key` is not configured.
  #partition.hash:
    # If enabled, events will only be published to partitions with reachable
    # leaders. Default is false.
    #reachable_only: false

    # Configure alternative event field names used to compute the hash value.
    # If empty `output.kafka.key` setting will be used.
    # Default value is empty list.
    #hash: []

  # Authentication details. Password is required if username is set.
  #username: ''
  #password: ''

  # Kafka version camsbeat is assumed to run against. Defaults to the oldest
  # supported stable version (currently version 0.8.2.0)
  #version: 0.8.2

  # Metadata update configuration. Metadata do contain leader information
  # deciding which broker to use when publishing.
  #metadata:
    # Max metadata request retry attempts when cluster is in middle of leader
    # election. Defaults to 3 retries.
    #retry.max: 3

    # Waiting time between retries during leader elections. Default is 250ms.
    #retry.backoff: 250ms

    # Refresh metadata interval. Defaults to every 10 minutes.
    #refresh_frequency: 10m

  # The number of concurrent load-balanced Kafka output workers.
  #worker: 1

  # The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
  # After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
  # Some Beats, such as Filebeat, ignore the max_retries setting and retry until
  # all events are published.  Set max_retries to a value less than 0 to retry
  # until all events are published. The default is 3.
  #max_retries: 3

  # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Kafka request. The default
  # is 2048.
  #bulk_max_size: 2048

  # The number of seconds to wait for responses from the Kafka brokers before
  # timing out. The default is 30s.
  #timeout: 30s

  # The maximum duration a broker will wait for number of required ACKs. The
  # default is 10s.
  #broker_timeout: 10s

  # The number of messages buffered for each Kafka broker. The default is 256.
  #channel_buffer_size: 256

  # The keep-alive period for an active network connection. If 0s, keep-alives
  # are disabled. The default is 0 seconds.
  #keep_alive: 0

  # Sets the output compression codec. Must be one of none, snappy and gzip. The
  # default is gzip.
  #compression: gzip

  # The maximum permitted size of JSON-encoded messages. Bigger messages will be
  # dropped. The default value is 1000000 (bytes). This value should be equal to
  # or less than the broker's message.max.bytes.
  #max_message_bytes: 1000000

  # The ACK reliability level required from broker. 0=no response, 1=wait for
  # local commit, -1=wait for all replicas to commit. The default is 1.  Note:
  # If set to 0, no ACKs are returned by Kafka. Messages might be lost silently
  # on error.
  #required_acks: 1

  # The number of seconds to wait for new events between two producer API calls.
  #flush_interval: 1s

  # The configurable ClientID used for logging, debugging, and auditing
  # purposes.  The default is "beats".
  #client_id: camsbeats-agent-66

  # Enable SSL support. SSL is automatically enabled, if any SSL setting is set.
  #ssl.enabled: true

  # Optional SSL configuration options. SSL is off by default.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  # Configure SSL verification mode. If `none` is configured, all server hosts
  # and certificates will be accepted. In this mode, SSL based connections are
  # susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing. Default is
  # `full`.
  #ssl.verification_mode: full

  # List of supported/valid TLS versions. By default all TLS versions 1.0 up to
  # 1.2 are enabled.

  #ssl.cipher_suites: []

  # Configure curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites
  #ssl.curve_types: []


#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: info

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]
#logging.to_syslog: true
